Born out of a desire to rival the more popular eateries of Bikini Bottom, particularly the Krusty Krab, we specialize in serving mystery meats, unconventional flavors, and unforgettable (sometimes questionable) dishes. While our menu might not be for everyone, those with an adventurous spirit know there’s always something new and exciting waiting for them at The Chum Bucket. From the infamous Chum Bites to our signature Chum-ade, we promise an experience that will leave a lasting impression—whether it’s good or bad!"

Every item on our menu is crafted with a touch of mystery, a sprinkle of sea creatures, and a whole lot of heart (or maybe just a lot of Chum). We pride ourselves on pushing the boundaries of what food can be. Why serve the same old boring meals when you can have something that really challenges your taste buds? That’s why our creations are truly one-of-a-kind—because when you dine with us, you’re in for an experience unlike any other."

I came here expecting a meal I’d never forget, and I was right! The Chum Bites were, uh, unusual, but I’ll admit, they had a certain charm to them. The Chum-ade? A little too tangy for my liking, but it kept me on my toes. I’m not sure what’s in that soup, but I swear there’s some science behind it. Definitely a place for the curious, if you can stomach it!",

    review: "I love this place! I don’t know what they put in the Grilled Chumwich, but it’s like every bite feels like I’m hugging a rock under the sea. I’ve eaten here like, a million times! The Mushy Sea Slaw is super mushy, which I love because it’s like eating a cloud made of slaw. The only downside is I keep falling asleep at the table after, but maybe that’s just me. Anyway, go eat here if you like food... or if you’re like me and you like things that are squishy and weird.",

    review: "I honestly don’t know why I keep going back. Maybe I enjoy suffering. Maybe I’m a masochist. Or maybe I just love the Chum Chowder’s mystery—I really can’t say. The atmosphere is, as you would expect, dreadful, and the food is even worse. But there’s something... oddly intriguing about the whole place. The Seaweed Chips taste like wet leaves, but it’s the type of wet leaves I can’t stop eating. Wouldn’t bring my worst enemy here, but... I’ll be back for more Fried Mystery Meat Nuggets. They’re weirdly addictive.",

I can’t tell you what was in it, but I do know I felt my wallet *heavier* after I left—so that’s something, right? If you’re in the mood for a *pricey* stomach ache, then I guess it’s worth a try. Otherwise, stick to the Krusty Krab, where we actually care about our customers!",

Sure, it’s not for the faint of heart, but if you’re looking for something that’ll really challenge your taste buds—and your sense of adventure—this is the spot. The Chum Bucket Surprise is an experience you’ll never forget... even if you want to. I know the locals complain about the *questionable* flavors, but you can’t make an omelet without cracking a few eggs! And who needs eggs when you have *plankton-based* dishes that make your stomach do backflips? It’s the future of dining!",

Not gonna lie, the food's a little too weird for my usual post-gym routine, but hey, it was *something*. I got a good laugh, though, and if you’re up for a challenge, the Fried Mystery Meat Nuggets will give you the most bizarre workout your taste buds have ever had. If you’re a thrill-seeker, go for it, but maybe hit the gym afterwards.",

We had good ol' fish and chips, not this... this *slop* they serve at The Chum Bucket. I tried the Chum Chowder, and I think it’s the reason my arthritis flared up. And don’t get me started on the Soggy Sponge Squares. Whatever happened to *real* food, I ask you? I guess if you like strange food that defies logic, this place might work for you. I’ll stick to my canned tuna, thank you very much!",
